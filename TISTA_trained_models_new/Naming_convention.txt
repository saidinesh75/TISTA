Type of model:
GT - TISTA for general sparsity case
SGT - TISTA for general sparse case (i.e., the same structure) but SPARC messages and codewords are used for training
ST - TISTA for SPARCs i.e., mmse function changed according to SPARCs and SPARC codewords are used for training

n= length of codeword
N= length of the message vector
layers = number of layers in the model

i- incremental training (training layer wise)
o- one shot training of the whole model


Naming convention:
(GT/SGT)_nN_snr_layers_(i/o)
ST_nN_EbN0_layers_(i/o)

Example: 
SGT_n64N512_20_7: model represents a TISTA for general sparsity case with n=64, N=512, SNR=20, 
no_layers=7
